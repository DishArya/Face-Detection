# Face-Detection (which Celibrity you look Alike)
 This project involves the development of a face recognition system that identifies the closest resembling Bollywood actor or actress from
 a predefined dataset based on the input image provided by the user. Leveraging Python along with machine learning libraries such as
 OpenCV, face recognition, NumPy, and Pandas, the system extracts facial features (encodings) and compares them to those stored in
 a celebrity database to determine the most similar face.
